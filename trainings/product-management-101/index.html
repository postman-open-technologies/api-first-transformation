               <p>It has become essential to doing business in the modern digital landscape that we are perpetually maximizing the value produced through our partner and public APIs. This narrative and supporting curriculum and workspace are designed to help you understand how you can maximize business value with your customers securely by publishing external APIs and treating them as a product.</p>
               <p>This module intends to help set the stage for what you will learn throughout this training, with the following modules:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Portals Are the Status Quo In Many Enterprises</strong> - Starting from the current state of API engagement with consumers that is centered around the publicly available API portal.</li>
                  <li><strong>Documentation For Our APIs Is Always Critical</strong> - Centering our engagement with consumers around essential API documentation while demonstrating how the space is changing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Collections as a Modular Unit of Engagement</strong> - Helping us be more modular in how we make our APIs available through the usage of executable and sharable Postman Collections.</li>
                  <li><strong>Workspace Show Our Homework in Real-Time</strong> - Revealing the importance of having a dedicated workspace around each of your APIs to properly engage with your consumers.</li>
                  <li><strong>Networks Are the Future of API Engagement</strong> - Exposing your APIs and the workspace behind them using partner or public workspaces to help focus engagement with consumers.</li>
                  <li><strong>Run In Postman Meets Developers Where They Are</strong> - Empowering you to use embeddable Run in Postman buttons to meet developers where they are as part of their work.</li>
                  <li><strong>Investing in Developer Experience is What Matters</strong> - Making your API available to consumers is much more than just a portal and docs and requires a focus on the overall experience.</li>
                  <li><strong>Measuring Meaningful Engagement with Consumers</strong> - Collections provide a unique opportunity to measure very modular and meaningful with your API consumers via workspaces.</li>
                  <li><strong>Leveraging and Learning with Feedback Loops</strong> - Utilizing comments to focus your feedback loops with consumers, helping API producers learn from how consumers are using APIs.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>This training will focus on demo workspace, APIs, collections, and other supporting developer resources to help make this narrative a hands-on experience.  You should walk away from this training module with a better awareness of how engaging with API consumers has evolved in recent years, and have a base understanding of how you can use Postman to maximize value with your partner and public APIs.
